Zooming, Rotating World Map Done with D3 and TopoJson
============
Started building, having problems finishing, but maybe someone can move forward with it.

Wishlist
--------
- [ ] Dynamic Simplification (click the small tip of Russia on the left and see the lag)

Todo
----
- [x] Select sync between the map and the multi-select box
- [ ] Disable clicking while the transition is happening

Bugs
----
- [ ] Moving from one place to another doesn't always move to the same way (like click Australia, then New Zealand. Russia to Norway also screws it up)
- [ ] Zooming in and out doesn't transition the outlines correctly
- [ ] It makes FF die D:
